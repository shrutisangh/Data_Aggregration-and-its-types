# Data_Aggregration-and-its-types
This project demonstrates data aggregation in data mining using Python and Pandas. It covers aggregation techniques such as sum, mean, count, min, and max, along with multi-level, time-based, and spatial aggregation. The notebook provides a practical way to summarize raw transactional data for analysis and decision-making.
